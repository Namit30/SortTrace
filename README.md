## Overview

**SortTrace** is a web-based sorting algorithm visualizer designed to help users understand and compare different sorting algorithms through interactive and intuitive visualizations. This project aims to break down complex sorting concepts in an engaging way, perfect for students, developers, or anyone looking to deepen their understanding of sorting algorithms.

## Features

- Visualizes a variety of sorting algorithms in real-time.
- Compare time complexities of algorithms like:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Heap Sort
- Dynamic array size adjustment to see how the algorithm performs with different input sizes.
- Visual feedback with color changes to highlight sorting progress.
- Interactive user interface with start, pause, and reset options.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing and visualizing the sorting algorithms.

## Getting Started
